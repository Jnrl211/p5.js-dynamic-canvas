# p5.js-dynamic-canvas
A template for a Processing (p5.js mode) canvas that can be dragged around with the mouse, and zoomed in and out with the keyboard.

## Running
Open "index.html" in your web browser of choice, a pair of rectangles in opposite ends of a corner on the center of the screen will show up. Drag the canvas around with the mouse, and zoom-in and zoom-out with the "z" and "x" keys. Make sure Caps Lock is off, or the canvas will not respond to zoom-in and zoom-out events, unless you define different keys for said events.
